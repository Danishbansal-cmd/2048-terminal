# 2048-terminal

So bascically this is the working of the 2048 game in 1-d which will run in your terminal window of the pycharm, or other window.
it cant use the keyboard keys so i have use the numbers(1,2,3,4) to move left,right,up,down respectively.
My main intention behind this project was to make clear use of arrays and make your logic strong.
It is really a fun to made to this project. Like a actual game it also calculates your realtime Score.

hope you like my work, for any queries comment below
